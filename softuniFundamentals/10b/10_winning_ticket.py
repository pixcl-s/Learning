
# You are given a collection of tickets separated by commas and spaces (one or many).
# You need to check each ticket to see if it has a winning combination of symbols:
# A valid ticket has exactly 20 characters.
# A winning ticket is a valid one, containing one of the symbols '@', '#', '$' or '^'
# uninterruptedly repeated at least 6 times in both halves of the tickets.
# In order to win a Jackpot, the ticket should contain the same winning symbol 10 times on both sides
# An example of a valid winning ticket:
# "Cash$$$$$$Ca$$$$$$sh"
# An example of a Jackpot winning valid ticket:
# "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
# Input
# The input will be read from the console. The input consists of a single line containing all tickets separated by
# commas and one or more white spaces in the format:
# "{ticket}, {ticket}, â€¦ {ticket}"
# Output
# Print the result for every ticket in the order of their appearance, each on a separate line in the format:
# If the ticket is invalid: "invalid ticket"
# If the ticket is valid, but it is not winning: "ticket "{ticket}" - no match"
# If the ticket is valid and winning, but not a Jackpot:
# "ticket "{ticket}" - {uninterrupted_match_length}{match_symbol}"
# If the ticket hits the Jackpot:
# "ticket "{ticket}" - {uninterrupted_match_length}{match_symbol} Jackpot!"
