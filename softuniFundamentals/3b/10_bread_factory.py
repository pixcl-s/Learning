# You will be given a string representing the working day events
# . Each event is separated with '|' (vertical bar): "event1|event2| â€¦ eventN"
# Each event contains an event name or an ingredient and a number, separated by a dash ("{event/ingredient}-{number}")
# If the event is "rest":
# You gain energy (the number in the second part).
# Note: your energy cannot exceed your initial energy (100).
# Print: "You gained {gained_energy} energy.".
# After that, print your current energy: "Current energy: {current_energy}.".
# If the event is "order":
# You've earned some coins (the number in the second part).
# Each time you get an order, your energy decreases by 30 points.
# If you have the energy to complete the order, print: "You earned {earned} coins.".
# Otherwise, skip the order and gain 50 energy points. Print: "You had to rest!".
# In any other case, you have an ingredient you should buy.
# The second part of the event contains the coins you should spend.
# If you have enough money, you should buy the ingredients and print:
# "You bought {ingredient}."
# Otherwise, print "Closed! Cannot afford {ingredient}." and your bakery rush is over.
# If you managed to handle all events throughout the day, print on the following 3 lines:
# "Day completed!"
# "Coins: {coins}"
# "Energy: {energy}"
