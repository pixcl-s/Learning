# Write a program that finds the sum of all numbers in a matrix's primary diagonal (runs from top left to bottom right).
# On the first line, you will receive an integer N â€“ the size of a square matrix.
# The next N lines hold the values for each column - N numbers, separated by a single space.
# input                 output
# 3                     4
# 11 2 4
# 4 5 6
# 10 8 -12
