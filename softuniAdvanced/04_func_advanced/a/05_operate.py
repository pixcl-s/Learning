# Write a function called operate that receives an operator ("+", "-", "*" or "/")
# as Ð° first argument and multiple numbers (integers) as additional arguments (*args).
# The function should return the result of the operator applied to all the numbers.
# For more clarification, see the examples below.
# Submit only your function in the Judge system.
# Note: Be careful when you have multiplication and division
# test                              output
# print(operate("+", 1, 2, 3))      6
