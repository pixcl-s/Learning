
# Each robot has a processing time â€“ it is the time in seconds the robot needs to process a product.
# When a robot is free, it should take a product for processing and log its name, product, and processing start time.
# Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line.
# A product is coming from the line each second (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]).
# If a product passes the line and there is not a free robot to take it,
# it should be queued at the end of the line again.
# The robots are standing in line in the order of their appearance.
# Input
# On the first line, you will receive the robots' names and their processing times in the format
# "robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime..."
# On the second line, you will get the starting time in the format "hh:mm:ss"
# Next, until the "End" command, you will get a product on each line.
# Output
# Every time a robot takes a product, you should print: "{robotName} - {product} [hh:mm:ss]"
