
# There is a circle road with N petrol pumps.
# The petrol pumps are numbered 0 to (Nâˆ’1) (both inclusive).
# For each petrol pump, you will receive two pieces of information (separated by a single space):
# The amount of petrol the petrol pump will give you
# The distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump (kilometers)
# You are a truck driver, and you want to go all around the circle.
# You know that the truck consumes 1 liter of petrol per 1 kilometer, and its tank has infinite petrol capacity.
# In the beginning, the tank is empty,
# but you start your journey at a petrol pump so you can fill it with the given amount of petrol.
# Your task is to calculate the first petrol pump from where the truck will be able to complete the circle.
# You never miss filling its tank at a petrol pump.
# Input
# On the first line, you will receive the number of petrol pumps - N
# On the next N lines, you will receive the amount of petrol that each petrol pump will give
# and the distance between that petrol pump and the next petrol pump, separated by a single space
# Output
# An integer which will be the smallest index of a petrol pump from which you can start the tour
