# The Song class should receive a name (string), a length (float), and a single (bool) upon initialization. It has one method:
#   - get_info()
#       o Returns the information of the song in this format: "{song_name} - {song_length}"
#       The Album class should receive a name (string) upon initialization and might receive one or more songs. It also has instance attributes: published (False by default) and songs (an empty list). It has four methods:
#   - add_song(song: Song)
#       o Adds the song to the album and returns "Song {song_name} has been added to the album {name}."
#       o If the song is single, returns "Cannot add {song_name}. It's a single"
#       o If the album is published, returns "Cannot add songs. Album is published."
#       o If the song is already added, return "Song is already in the album."
#   - remove_song(song_name: str)
#       o Removes the song with the given name and returns "Removed song {song_name} from album {album_name}."
#       o If the song is not in the album, return "Song is not in the album."
#       o If the album is published, returns "Cannot remove songs. Album is published."
#   - publish()
#       o Publishes the album (set to True) and returns "Album {name} has been published."
#       o If the album is published, returns "Album {name} is already published."
#   - details()
#       o Returns the information of the album, with the songs in it, in the format:
#           "Album {name}
#           == {first_song_info}
#           == {second_song_info}
#           â€¦
#           == {n_song_info}"
# The Band class should receive a name (string) upon initialization. It also has an attribute albums (an empty list).
# The class has three methods:
#   - add_album(album: Album)
#       o Adds an album to the collection and returns "Band {band_name} has added their newest album {album_name}."
#       o If the album is already added, returns "Band {band_name} already has {album_name} in their library."
#   - remove_album(album_name: str)
#       o Removes the album from the collection and returns "Album {name} has been removed."
#       o If the album is published, return "Album has been published. It cannot be removed."
#       o If the album is not in the collection, return "Album {name} is not found."
#   - details()
#       o Returns the information of the band, with their albums, in this format:
#           "Band {name}
#           {album details}
#           ...
#           {album details}"
