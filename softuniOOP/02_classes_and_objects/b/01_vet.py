# Create a class called Vet. The Vet class represents a veterinary doctor in an animal clinic.
# Upon initialization, it should receive a name (string - the name of the vet doctor).
# It should also have an instance attribute called animals (empty list by default).
# There should also be 2 class attributes: animals (empty list) which will store the total amount of animals for all vet doctors;
# and space (5 by default, representing the total capacity of the clinic).
# You should create 3 additional instance methods:
# - register_animal(animal_name)
#   o If there is available space in the vet clinic, add the animal to both animals' lists and return a message:
#   "{name} registered in the clinic"
#   o Otherwise, return "Not enough space"
# - unregister_animal(animal_name)
#   o If the animal is in the clinic, remove it from both animals' lists and return "{animal} unregistered successfully"
#   o Otherwise, return "{animal} not in the clinic"
# - info()
#   o Return info about the vet doctor, the number of animals on his/her list, and the available space left in the clinic:
# "{vet_name} has {number_animals} animals. {space_left_in_clinic} space left in clinic"
