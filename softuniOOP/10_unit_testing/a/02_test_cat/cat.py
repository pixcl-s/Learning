# Create a class CatTests
# * In Judge, you must submit just the CatTests class, with the unittest module imported and the main block.
# Create the following tests:
#   · The cat's size is increased after eating
#   · Cat is fed after eating
#   · Cat cannot eat if already fed, raises an error
#   · Cat cannot fall asleep if not fed, raises an error
#   · Cat is not sleepy after sleeping
# Hints
# Follow the logic of the previous problem
